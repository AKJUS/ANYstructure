# ANYstructure
 GUI based steel structure calculation tool.
 
 The following is calculated:
  - Minimum plate thickness (DNVGL-OS-C101)
  - Minimum section modulus of stiffener/plate (DNVGL-OS-C101)
  - Minimum shear area (DNVGL-OS-C101)
  - Buckling (DNVGL-RP-C201)
  - Fatigue for plate/stiffener connection (DNGGL-RP-C203)

Compartments (tank pressures) are created automatically.

Pressures on external hull (or any other generic location) is defined by specifying equations.

Start application by running main_application.py
